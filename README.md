# Machine-Learning-Course
A collection of programming questions from UCLA's machine learning course in the math department. This class was taken with Dr. Jamie Haddock, my current research mentor who recently started working at Harvey Mudd, please view her website for any further information: https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jhaddock/

The majority of this class was very theortically grounded using complex mathematical concepts from linear algebra, optimization, multivariable calculus, and more. The main topics included in this class were:
* Kernels
* Maximum likelyhood and least squares
* sequential learning
* Bayesian linear regression
* (Probobalistic) discrimiant functions
* Logistic regression
* Maximum margin classifiers and support vector machines
* Preceptrons and neural networks
* Backpropogation and network training
* (probabilistic and kernel) Principal component Analysis
* K-means Clustering
* EM for gaussian mixtures
