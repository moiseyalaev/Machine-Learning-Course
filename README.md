# Machine-Learning-Course
A collection of programming questions from UCLA's machine learning course in the math department. This class was taken with Dr. Jamie Haddock, my current research mentor who recently started working at Harvey Mudd, please view her website for any further information: https://www.math.ucla.edu/~jhaddock/

The majority of this class was very theortically grounded using complex mathematical concepts from linear algebra, optimization, multivariable calculus, and more. If interested in the type of mathematical work undertaken by this class, please free to reach out to me at moiseyalaev@gmail.com.
